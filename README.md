Abortion Legislation and Its Consequences on Maternal and Child Health

This data science project explores the long-term consequences of abortion laws on the health and well-being of mothers and children in the United States. Using a synthesized dataset, we analyze how restrictive policies may impact maternal mortality, infant health outcomes, and broader trends over the years.


Project Motivation

In light of increasing restrictions on abortion access across the U.S., this project investigates the human costâ€”particularly how legal policies affect not just the availability of reproductive care but also the health outcomes of mothers and their children over time. Our goal is to inform and inspire socially responsible dialogue using data-driven insights.
