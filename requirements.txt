Option 1: Use a Jupyter cell with !pip
In any cell in your notebook, run:
!pip install statsmodels

This installs statsmodels directly into the environment your Jupyter Notebook is running in.

Option 2: Install from terminal in the Jupyter environment
If you are running Jupyter from Anaconda or a virtual environment, open the terminal within Jupyter or your system terminal, and run:
pip install statsmodels

Step 3: Import and check
After installation, go back to your notebook and add:
import statsmodels.api as sm
print(sm.__version__)

If no error appears and the version is printed, the installation was successful!
